## Challenge Description
This challenge involves a login page that implements authentication logic using JavaScript. On the login page, there are hidden elements and an authentication function that checks the username and password match. Important information is hidden in the `secure.js` file, which contains the actual password to solve the challenge.

## Solution Steps

1. **Examine the Authentication Function**
   The JavaScript code in the `secure.js` file contains the `checkPassword()` function that checks the username and password match. This function only returns `true` if the username is `admin` and the password is `strongPassword098765`.

2. **Identify Critical Elements**
   - The variables `window.username` and `window.password` are set to the initial value `admin`.
   - The `filter()` function ensures the username and password only contain alphanumeric characters.
   - If the username and password pass validation, the `checkPassword()` function is called to check authentication.

3. **Find the Correct Password**
   From the `secure.js` code, it is known that the correct password is `strongPassword098765`. Use this password to authenticate the login.

4. **Simulate Login**
   Enter the username `admin` and the password `strongPassword098765` into the authentication logic. After a successful login, the page will automatically fill in the hidden form and redirect to the admin page.
